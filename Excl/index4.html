          Almaty (/ˈælməti/; Kazakh: Алматы, romanized: Almaty; Kazakh
          pronunciation: [ɑlmɑˈtɯ] (listen)) is the largest city in Kazakhstan,
          with a population of about 2 million.[5] It was the capital of
          Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1936 as a autonomous republic within the
          Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as part of the Soviet
          Union, then from 1936 to 1991 as a union republic and finally from
          1991 as an independent state to 1997[6] when the government relocated
          the capital to Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998, and Nur-Sultan in
          2019).

          Almaty is still the major commercial and cultural centre of
          Kazakhstan, as well as its most populous and most cosmopolitan
          city.[7] The city is located in the mountainous area of southern
          Kazakhstan near the border with Kyrgyzstan in the foothills of the
          Trans-Ili Alatau at an elevation of 700–900 m (2,300–3,000 feet),
          where the Large and Small Almatinka rivers run into the plain.[8]

          The city, just like Nur-Sultan and Shymkent, doesn't belong to any
          region and is officially a "city of state importance". The city has
          been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of music
          since November 2017.[9] The city was the host for a 1978 international
          conference on Primary Health Care where the Almaty Declaration was
          adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health.
